# Text to Speech with Azure Cognitive Skills

## Objective

The Flask Text to Speech (TTS) application aims to provide a simple web interface for users to convert text into speech using Microsoft's Text to Speech API. The primary goal is to create an intuitive user experience for generating audio files from entered text, facilitating tasks such as creating voiceovers or generating audio content from written text.

### Tools Used
Flask: A micro web framework for Python.

Azure Cognitive Services: External API used for text-to-speech conversion.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Frontend technologies for designing and interacting with the web interface.
